## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use DAYMONYEAR.MAJOR.MINOR
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off from existing maintainers.

**NOTE:** Currently contributions on github will need to be manually imported to the project source in a local gitlab repository. I aim to resolve this eventually but it is not as important as getting the code and guidance put together so is a lower priority.

The following are basic commands for docker container management that need to be used regularly [for quick reference for non-docker experts. ;-)]

List running docker containers:
'docker container list'

Get very detailed information on a docker container:
'docker inspect <containerIdOrName>'

Obtain a 'bash' command prompt on the docker container:
'docker exec -it <containerIdOrName> bash'
